# About

A Chrome Extension that Tells if a website has Tailwind CSS

# How it works

Build with Tailwind CSS looks for the word 'tailwind' or 'tailwindcss' in a webpage.

Earlier versions of Tailwind CSS do not include the above words in the generated stylesheets.

Therefore, this extension works for only newer versions of Tailwind CSS - version 2 and above. I need to further investigate this.
