About:
Detects Tailwind CSS use in a web page.

If it does, it displays the version and a green check mark. 

If not, it displays a red "X" icon and "No Tailwind CSS detected".

How it works:
Build with Tailwind CSS looks for the word ‘tailwind’, ‘tailwindcss’,  '--tw-bg-opacity', and more in a web page's style sheets.

Earlier versions of Tailwind CSS do not include the above words in the generated style sheets.

Therefore, this extension works for only newer versions of Tailwind CSS - version 2 and above.
